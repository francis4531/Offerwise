## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### **Before v4.8.3 (INCONSISTENT):**

**Section 1 - OfferScore:**

📊 The Numbers Tell a Story ← Generic title
[Content immediately starts]
```

**Section 2 - Risk DNA:**
```
🧬 Property Risk DNA™ ← Branded title
Patent Pending • Proprietary Multi-Dimensional Risk Encoding ← Subtitle
Description paragraph explaining the innovation ← Context
[Content]
```

**Section 3 - Transparency Report:**
```
